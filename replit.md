# PokéShop - Pokémon E-commerce Platform

## Overview

PokéShop is a frontend-focused e-commerce platform for buying and selling Pokémon. The application is built as a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript website with a clean, modern interface that includes both customer-facing pages and an administrative interface. The platform features a responsive design with Pokémon-themed styling and comprehensive product management capabilities.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Static HTML Pages**: The application consists of three main HTML pages:
  - `index.html`: Main customer interface with product catalog
  - `pokemon-detail.html`: Individual Pokémon product detail page
  - `admin.html`: Administrative interface for managing the store
- **CSS Architecture**: Modular CSS structure with:
  - `main.css`: Core styles and global components
  - `admin.css`: Administrative interface specific styles
  - `pokemon-detail.css`: Product detail page specific styles
- **External Dependencies**: Font Awesome 6.0.0 for icons via CDN

### Design System
- **Color Scheme**: Purple-blue gradient background with white content areas
- **Typography**: Arial font family for clean readability
- **Component-Based Styling**: Reusable CSS classes for buttons, cards, and layouts
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with flexible grid systems

## Key Components

### Customer Interface
1. **Header Navigation**: Fixed header with logo and navigation links
2. **Hero Section**: Call-to-action area with gradient background
3. **Product Catalog**: Filterable product grid with category-based filtering
4. **Product Detail View**: Comprehensive Pokémon information display

### Administrative Interface
1. **Admin Header**: Specialized navigation for administrative functions
2. **Sidebar Navigation**: Category-based admin menu structure
3. **Dashboard Components**: Management interfaces for:
   - Pokémon inventory
   - Order management
   - Category administration
   - User management

### Styling Components
1. **Layout System**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts
2. **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects and transitions
3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Consistent spacing and typography scales
4. **Theming**: Pokémon-inspired color palette and iconography

## Data Flow

### Current Implementation
- **Static Data**: Product information is currently hardcoded in HTML
- **Client-Side Filtering**: Category filters implemented via radio buttons
- **Image Integration**: Uses PokeAPI sprites for Pokémon images
- **Navigation Flow**: Hash-based routing for single-page navigation

### Planned Data Flow
- **Product Management**: Admin interface suggests CRUD operations for Pokémon
- **Order Processing**: Admin interface includes order management capabilities
- **User Management**: Administrative user handling functionality
- **Category Management**: Dynamic category creation and management

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party Services
1. **Font Awesome 6.0.0**: Icon library via CDN
2. **PokeAPI**: Pokémon image sprites (referenced in detail page)

### Asset Management
- **Image Hosting**: External image URLs for Pokémon sprites
- **CDN Integration**: Font Awesome loaded from external CDN
- **Static Assets**: Local CSS files for styling

## Deployment Strategy

### Current Setup
- **Static Hosting**: Application designed for static file hosting
- **No Build Process**: Direct HTML/CSS/JavaScript deployment
- **CDN Dependencies**: External resources loaded at runtime

### Deployment Considerations
- **Web Server**: Any static file server (Apache, Nginx, or hosting platforms)
- **Domain Setup**: Standard DNS configuration for web hosting
- **SSL/HTTPS**: Recommended for production deployment
- **Performance**: CDN usage for static assets and external dependencies

## Technical Notes

### Current Limitations
- **No Backend**: Application is purely frontend without server-side functionality
- **Static Data**: Product information is hardcoded and not dynamic
- **No Database**: No persistent data storage implementation
- **Limited Interactivity**: Basic filtering without advanced features

### Future Enhancements
- **Backend Integration**: The architecture suggests preparation for backend services
- **Database Integration**: Admin interface implies need for data persistence
- **Authentication**: Admin area suggests user authentication requirements
- **API Integration**: Structure supports REST API implementation for CRUD operations

### Browser Compatibility
- **Modern Browsers**: CSS Grid and Flexbox require modern browser support
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic functionality works without JavaScript
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop compatibility built-in
